# The Only Tea Shop In Isengard

_by Owen Niblock_
_Original Idea by Victoria Chapman_

Derick is an Uruk-hai
But sensitive and pretty shy
It's not fighting that gets him high
It's a well brewed steaming cup of chai.

When the battle went awry
And poor Derick lost his eye
It made him see that he should try
A job he liked to get him by (?) <--- revisit this line

"I like tea"
Proud Derick thought.
As he sought to change his fate.
"So let's see"
"What I ought to be"

-- CHORUS --
He found a space in Isengard
The human's fled it wasn't hard
And so nobody there could stop
Middle Earth's first Orc Tea Shop.

Derick's Delightful Darjeeling,
Assam, Camomile the flavours sing
Every type of tea that there was to see
Nettle, Oolang Rose & Barley

The other Uruk-hai said no
They didn't like his wares
They didn't like his Pau d’arco
And he was met with sneers & stares

He didn't let that stop him
He even served the army chief
In his finest china pot
A cup of sweetest raspberry leaf

"This will work"
Proud Derick thought.
Even though they teased him so
"I won't shirk"
"Just ignore that jerk"

-- CHORUS --
He found a space in Isengard
The human's fled it wasn't hard
And so nobody there could stop
Middle Earth's first Orc Tea Shop.

And then one day
A stranger came
He had an eye for Derick's shop
And before Sauroman could stop
It he did say

"I'd like
Earl Grey, elvish or maybe Mint Tea
See, my name's Sauron and I do like a cuppa
So put the **cking kettle on and I'll start making supper."
