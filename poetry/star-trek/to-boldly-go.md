# To Boldy Go

_By Owen Niblock_

Riddled with disease
Bruises.
Scrapes upon his knees.
The pain on his face
From the carpet burn of his disgrace
Captain James T. Kirk
With his letcherous smirk
Travels the galaxy,
And what does he see?

Opportunity
A chance to be
Loved?
No, embraced perhaps
A kiss
With another race, perhaps
And maybe more

And so his constant refrain
A stain
Upon his character

And Bones will often say
Jim what have you done?
I cannot cure him
He's dead Jim
You'll never come again.
Captain James T Kirk
With his letcherous smirk
Will smile and say, that is not so
I tell you
I will boldy go.

And that he will
To spread his seed
To those vulnerable
Aliens in need.
A man.
A real man indeed.
A man who preys on those he's freed.

And so his face of endless strain
Once more that look of joyful pain
And then he snores again

And Bones will often say
How the hell have you got these?
These Romulan fleas?
These Klingon crabs
They leave you in tatters
With serious scabs
"Now that's a story"
Jim will grin
And wipe the spittle
From his chin

This sad, sad Captain
and his dirty quest
Is he really
Our species best
He cannot take his beady eyes
Off that purple creature's thighs
Or that poor young Yeomen's chest

In the current century
They wouldn't let this man be free
To grope and stare and drool and spit
And Spock would call him out on it.
