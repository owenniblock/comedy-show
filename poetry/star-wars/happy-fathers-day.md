# Darth Dad

NOTE: Could do a poem in the voice of Yoda? Write it, I will.

Darth Vader 
Darth Vader
You're a terrible Dad
Darth Vader 
Darth Vader
You made poor Luke sad

Darth Vader
Darth Vader
You're a terrible Cad
Darth Vader 
Darth Vader
You made Leia mad

Chopping off a hand is not an appropriate punishment for a child
You might want to start with a naughty step or something just as mild
Blowing up a planet will most likely cause irrevokable psychological harm
You should always aim to dish out responses when you're cross but also calm

Darth Vader
Darth Vader
You're a terrible Dad
Darth Vader 
Darth Vader
Children, you had (in Yoda's voice)

You never changed a nappy
You never made them happy
The dark side is no excuse for poor parenting style
I know that the truth will often sting but
The dark side is no excuse for poor parenting

A breath
A breath again
A strangled cry
And the minions die
But that hollow feeling in your heart
It's been there from the very start

Darth Vader 
Darth Vader
Darth Vader 
Darth Vader

Didn't he redeem himself in the end?
I don't think that's enough to defend
23 years of not being there
18 years of zero childcare

Darth Vader 
Darth Vader
You're a terrible Dad
Darth Vader 
Darth Vader
You're a terrible Dad

And still I phoned and had to say,
Have a happy father's day.
